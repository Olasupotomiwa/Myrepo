                        History of The Sigma Club. 
         </Text>


        <p>
          The Sigma Club was founded in 1950 with Christopher Okigbo playing a principal role. Among the Original founders of the club were D.O Olojede-Nelson(First Sigma President)EugeneFrmibOdunjo, Christopher Okigbo, Leslie Oritsenweyinmi Harriman, Ignatius Atigbi, Felix Nkendu, Carolus Gomez (First Sigma Treasurer), Banjo Dolarun, E.E.

                        The name stemmed from his interest in classics. Okigbo might have also heard the name "Sigma" from his elder brother Pius Okigbo who was then at an American University where Sigma fraternities were famous. Okigbo aimed to inspire a club in the tradition of merit and excellence claimed by Sigma fraternities in the United States.

                        Pre-existed the Sigma club were drama club, pi pbi psi fraternity, cricket club, the social circle, the dancing club, and many other clubs. Sigma Club was distinct from other clubs in character, ideal, activity, and impact. Her members demonstrated high moral ethics and standards. Their activities and gatherings were directed by common and shared values. They saw zero need to document their objectives and goals as they thrived on ideals and traditions. With no written constitution or side of conduct.

                        Okigbo and his associates founded Sigma Club as a distinguished university society on campus. They registered the club taking their seal from the Greek mathematical - Sigma. The Greek symbols were to lend gravitas to the uniqueness of the Club. The dancing club was the most prominent social club at that time. However, with the effluxion of time, Signa Club dominated the social scenes in Ibadan and became the most exclusive and elitist of the student clubs on campus. Members of the club were intellectually and socially fashionable and elect.

                        Sigma Club later flourished and earned its standing and reputation as the club for stylish young men, distinct in character, discipline, and integrity at Ibadan. The club's rules underscored a strict dress code of sartorial classiness at all times. Members of the club became known and addressed as Sigmites. They were properly dressed in suits and now ties. They appear classy, gentle, and befitting. They were men of high importance and social relevance, Harriman, Odunjo, and Okigbo had their suits made by Fagbowo in 1953, being the most expensive city couture of that period in Ibadan. The Club attracted students driven by the aristocratic ideal of nobility, probity, and high endeavour. Sigma Club was a highbrow club with bourgeois formality and exclusive form. Its ideas of gentry mirrored the English colonial lifestyle.
